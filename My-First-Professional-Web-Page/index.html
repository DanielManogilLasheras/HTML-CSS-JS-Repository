                                <p>I'm a full stack developer who just completed my studies 1 year ago. Since then, I've been
                                    working in different small projects as a freelancer and upgrading my abilities by practicing and 
                                    participating in several tournaments. Although I have a full stack profile, I stand out for my abilities
                                    and knowledge in Java and Python programming languages.
                                </p>
